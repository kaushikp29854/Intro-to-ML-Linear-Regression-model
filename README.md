# Intro-to-ML-Linear-Regression-model

In this Project, I created a Linear regression model by scratch in python implementing gradient descent. We cleaned the dataset then found optimal values for various parameters such as learning rate, number of iterations, and any other stopping conditions that we used. We compared this to the LinearRegression model package. We used an insurance dataset.

Answer this question: Are you satisfied that you have found the best solution? Explain.

I am satisfied that we have found the best solution because we lowered  our mean squared error from 42.28 to 6.34176. Thus we are confident that we have gotten the best solution. WE can essentially predict  approximately 78% of the insurace prices based on the 6 features we are given based on our R2 Score in part 2.
