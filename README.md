# Intro-to-ML-Linear-Regression-model

In this Project, I created a Linear regression model by scratch in python implementing gradient descent. We cleaned the dataset then found optimal values for various parameters such as learning rate, number of iterations, and any other stopping conditions that we used. We compared this to the LinearRegression model package. We used an insurance dataset.
