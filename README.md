# Intro-to-ML-Linear-Regression-model

Running the code:
-Simply download  Part1.py and Part2.py then upload it on your favorite IDE then execute the code. In part 1 you will find a full analysis of the our insurance dataset that includes strength of correlation between features, ranges of prices between smokers and non-smokers, prices of people with high vs low BMI and insurance price range of different regions in the country and finally Insurance prices depending on the number of children.

- Analysis: Essentially, we have found out that smokers insurance price is significantly higher than non-smokers and their BMI is high as well. Moreover, people with 4 or more children have a lower insurance than people with lesser or no children

In this Project, I created a Linear regression model by scratch in python implementing gradient descent. We cleaned the dataset then found optimal values for various parameters such as learning rate, number of iterations, and any other stopping conditions that we used. We compared this to the Linear Regression model package. We used an insurance dataset.

Answer this question: Are you satisfied that you have found the best solution? Explain.

I am satisfied that we have found the best solution because we lowered  our mean squared error from 42.28 to 6.34176. Thus, we are confident that we have gotten the best solution.
In part we have also increased our R2 score from 78% to 80% which means that we can predict 80% of the insurance prices using our 6 features.
